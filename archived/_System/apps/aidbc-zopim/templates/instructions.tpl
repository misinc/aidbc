<h2>Working with the app</h2>

Once the app is installed and launched, you can add new images to the gallery using the "<strong>Add images</strong>" button. 
Images are saved to the <strong>/bc-gallery/images/</strong> folder.  
Deleting an image can be done right from the list using the delete image icon displayed when hovering over an image.

In the front-end things are pretty straightforward: the <strong>/bc-gallery/demo.html</strong> page lists all the images currently available in your gallery using the jQuery bxSlider plug-in.

<h2>Whatâ€™s required</h2>
