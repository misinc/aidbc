<h2 class="page-break-before"><small><strong>Step 1:</strong></small> Create a new Catalog</h2>
<p>Start by creating a catalog for your product to go into. A catalog is a group of related products, so you can also think of catalogs as categories. Catalogs are a way of organizing your store for your visitors.</p>
<p>Go to the BC admin (by clicking the Manage tab in Muse). On the left-side menu, go to E-Commerce &gt; Catalogs. Select &ldquo;Add Catalog&rdquo; and fill in the details asked for on the form.</p>
<p>The field &ldquo;Parent Catalog&rdquo; will give you a list of your catalogs. If you want your new catalog to be a sub-catalog of an existing one, then set the &ldquo;Parent Catalog&rdquo; field to that catalog. If you have no other catalogs, this field will simply say &ldquo;Root&rdquo;. You can set the &ldquo;Template&rdquo; field to the template you created in Muse.
