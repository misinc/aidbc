<h2 class="page-break-before"><small><strong>Step 1:</strong></small> Discount Codes</h2>
<a id="step2"></a>
<p>
You can offer special promotions through the Discount Codes feature. Your customers will be able to use the discount code when they check out. Discount codes are often useful around the holidays, or to increase sales for a new product or particular category of items.</p>
<p>Business Catalyst allows you to make three different types of Discount codes.</p>
    <div class="well"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded col-md-12" src="/images/tutorials/onlinestore-part2-1a.png" /></div>
<ol>
    <li>Percentage of Order</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: Get an additional 10% off through this week only!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Fixed Dollar Amount</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: Take $5 off when you spend $80 or more</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Free Shipping</li>
</ol>
    <h4>Creating Discount Codes</h4>
    <p>To create a Discount Code go to your Business Catalyst admin (or by clicking the Manage button in Muse). On the left side menu go to E-Commerce &gt; Discount Codes.</p>
    <p>Now on the page you should see a form on the right and an open area on the left. All of your Discount Codes will be listed on the left. Fill out the form on the right to create a new Discount Code:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Give the discount code a descriptive name that will allow you to remember what it's for later. For example, "Christmas Holiday Free Shipping 2013"</li>
        <li><strong>Discount Code:</strong> In this field, type the code that will be used by customers to redeem the discount. The code can be a simple numerical combination, text, or both. The code cannot have spaces. You may use special characters.
        Examples: PKV884, Free_Shipping
        </li>
        <li>Select the type of discount code you'd like. If you choose Percentage of Order or Fixed Dollar Amount an additional field will pop up for you to specify this amount.</li>
        <li>Under the field "Apply Discount Only if Order Total Greater Than", you can specify a minimum total required in order to qualify for the discount.</li>
        <li><strong>Expire After X Redemptions</strong> limits the number of people who can use the discount code, <em>not</em> the number of uses per person. You might use this feature for a sale such as "The first 50 people who order will get $5 off! Act Fast!"</li>
        <li>Set a start and end date for the discount code under "Release Date" and "Expiry Date"</li>
        <li>Make sure the "Enabled" box is checked.</li>
        <li>Finally, hit "Save Discount Code".</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Adding Discount Code Field to Shopping cart</h4>
    <p>The discount code field is displayed on the shopping cart by default. If your shopping cart page doesn’t include it, you need to add it to your shopping cart layout so that customers can <em>enter&nbsp;</em>the discount code upon checking out.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to Site Manager &gt; Module Templates and select the "Online Shop Layouts" icon. Then, under the "Customize Check-Out Process Experience" section, choose "Shopping Cart"</li>
        <li>Select "Add modules and tags". A column called "Toolbox" will pop up on the right. In the Toolbox, select the "Data" tab. You will see a list of all the possible shopping cart tags.</li>
        <li>In the WISIWYG editor, place your cursor where you want the gift voucher field to go. Then locate and select the {tag_discountcode} tag in the Toolbox. The tag will appear where you placed your cursor.</li>
        <li>Finally, click Save.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="page-break-before"><small><strong>Step 2:</strong></small> Gift Vouchers</h2>
    <a id="step3"></a>
    <p>The Gift Vouchers feature in Business Catalyst allows you to create a
    gift voucher, or certificate, and send it to a specific customer through email.</p>
    <h4>Selling Gift Vouchers</h4>
    <p>You can also allow customers to purchase a gift voucher in your store. The gift voucher will simply be another product in your store, and is created the same way as other products. When a customer purchases a gift voucher they will choose who to send it too and specify a recipient email.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Go to E-Commerce &gt; Products. Select "Add Product" and fill out the details as you would any other product. Under the "Product Details" section, check the box called "Gift Voucher" to make the product a gift voucher. See <a href="/business-catalyst-muse-tutorials/managing-your-online-store-with-business-catalyst-part-1">Part 1</a> of this tutorial for more information on creating products.</p>
    <div class="well"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded col-md-12" src="/images/tutorials/onlinestore-part2-step2c.png" /></div>
    <a name="cart"></a>
    <h4>Adding Gift Voucher Field to Shopping cart</h4>
    <p>The gift voucher code field is displayed on the shopping cart by default. If your shopping cart page doesn’t include it, you need to add it to your shopping cart layout so that customers can&nbsp;<em>redeem</em> their gift vouchers.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to Site Manager &gt; Module Templates and select the "Online Shop Layouts" icon. Then, under the "Customize Check-Out Process Experience" section, choose "Shopping Cart"</li>
        <li>Select "Add modules and tags". A column called "Toolbox" will pop up on the right. In the Toolbox, select the "Data" tab. You will see a list of all the possible shopping cart tags.</li>
        <li>In the WISIWYG editor, place your cursor where you want the gift voucher field to go. Then locate and select the {tag_giftvoucher} tag in the Toolbox. The tag will appear where you placed your cursor.</li>
        <li>Finally, click Save.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="well"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded col-md-12" src="/images/tutorials/onlinestore-part2-step2b.png" /></div>
    <h4>Manually Creating Gift Vouchers</h4>
    <p>You can also manually create gift vouchers and email them to your customers. Go to E-Commerce &gt; Gift Vouchers. Select "Add Gift Voucher" and fill out the details on the form:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gift Voucher Code</strong>: The code you put in this field is what the recipient will use to redeem the gift voucher at&nbsp;<a href="#cart">check out</a>. This code can be a random combination of numbers and digits, or you can create a naming convention such as the date created followed by the recipient's initials. The code you enter should not be easy to guess or obvious, such as "1".</li>
        <li><strong>Value</strong>: Add the amount you want the gift voucher to be worth. The value will be in the currency of the county specified later in the form.</li>
        <li>Make sure the box "Enabled" is checked.</li>
        <li>Enter the "Recipient Name" and "Recipient Email"</li>
        <li><strong>Country</strong>: The country you specify will determine the currency of the gift voucher. You will most likely want this to be the country where your recipient resides.</li>
        <li><strong>Message</strong>: Add a message for your recipient. NOTE: The email your recipient receives can be customized under System Emails, but that will not be covered in this tutorial.</li>
        <li>Finally, click Save. Once you hit save, a new field will called "Balance" will appear below the "Enabled" box. This will track how much the voucher the recipient has used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="page-break-before"><small><strong>Step 3:</strong></small> Affiliate Program</h2>
    <a id="step4"></a>
    <p>An affiliate program allows you to reward other sites for linking to your store by giving them a commission on each sale they refer to you. To track these referrals, you need to create an affiliate program and allow sites to become affiliates. Each affiliate will have a unique affiliate code that they will use when linking to your site. This will allow Business Catalyst to track the referral sales. </p>
    
    <p>To create an affiliate program, you go to E-commerce &gt; Affiliate Programs and select &ldquo;Add Affiliate Program&rdquo;. Fill out the details on the form:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Affiliate Program Name</strong>: The landing page is the page where visitors will arrive when they click on the affiliate&rsquo;s link. You can make this destination page any page on your website, including your catalogues. </li>
        <li><strong>Commission (%)</strong>: Set the amount of commission you will pay to the affiliate. Make sure you enter the percent value as a decimal. Example: 5% should be entered as 0.05.
        <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Business Catalyst uses a pay per action system. This means you will pay the commission based on what the customer does on your site, rather than pay per click, which is a payment for every time a customer clicks on the link.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you&rsquo;re finished, click Save. </p>
    <div class="well"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded col-md-12" src="/images/tutorials/onlinestore-part2-step3a.png" /></div>
    <p>The &ldquo;Subscribers&rdquo; tab at the top, next to the &ldquo;Details&rdquo; tab, should now be active. Click on the &ldquo;Subscribers&rdquo; tab to add affiliates--the merchants who will have the refferal link to your site.</p>
    <p>To add a subscriber, fill out the details on the form. If you check the box &ldquo;Email Details to User&rdquo; then the subscriber will receive an email notifying them that they are subscribed as an affiliate. You can customize the exact text of this email by going to Site Manager &gt; System Emails &gt; Affiliate program details</p>
    <p>You can manage the details of each subscriber after you add them. A list of your subscribers will appear under the &ldquo;Subscribers&rdquo; tab. Click &ldquo;view&rdquo; next to the name of any subscriber to view statistics on the subscriber&rsquo;s activity in the program.</p>
    <div class="well"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded col-md-12" src="/images/tutorials/onlinestore-part2-step3b.png" /></div>
    <hr />
    <h2 class="page-break-before"><small><strong>Step 4:</strong></small> Payment Gateways</h2>
    <a id="step5"></a>
    <p>A payment gateway is necessary for your online store to be able to accept credit card payments. After you have set up a payment gateway with one of the following <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/business-catalyst/kb/supported-payment-gateway-providers.html" target="_blank">supported payment gateway providers</a> you can add the payment gateway to your site.</p>
    <h4>Configuring a Payment Gateway</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to E-commerce &gt; Payment Gateways</li>
        <li>Specify the country you are configuring the payment gateway for</li>
        <li>Select your gateway provider from the dropdown list under the <strong>&rdquo;Gateway&rdquo;</strong>

        <li>Once you&rsquo;ve selected your gateway, the fields required for the gateway will automatically come up. Fill out these details using the information provided by your payment gateway service provider. If you do not know the information contact your payment gateway provider for help.</li>
        <li>If you are using PayPal, fill out the PayPal Website Standard Section.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="well"><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded col-md-12" src="/images/tutorials/onlinestore-part2-step4b.png" /></div>
    <hr />
    <h2 class="page-break-before"><small><strong>Step 5:</strong></small> Tax Codes</h2>
    <a id="step6"></a>
    <p>Use the Tax Codes feature to apply tax to your products. Tax Codes can be used to specify tax for a certain region, state, or even specific product</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The dropdown menu &ldquo;<strong>Select a Country to Add a Tax Code</strong>&rdquo; will only list countries under which you have a domain name</li>

    <p>If you want to apply tax per state, simply click &ldquo;Add all USA state tax rates&rdquo;. The system will automatically create the Tax Code for each state.</p>
    <p>If you want a certain tax code to apply to a product regardless of the purchasers location, create the tax code and then add it to the product:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to E-commerce &gt; Products and select the product you want.</li>
        <li>Go to the Prices tab along the top.</li>
        <li>If you have more than one price for the product, select the price you want to add tax to from the list of prices in the left column.</li>
        <li>In the right hand column, at the bottom of the form, select the appropriate Tax Code from the dropdown field called &ldquo;<strong>Tax Code</strong>&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Click Save when you are finished.</li>
